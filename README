The .bin files are raw signed 16 bit, one channel audio samples at 24000 samples/sec.
The text files are the decoding of those packets at the time they were collected, but
note that the output format has changed since then. Mostly I wanted to have the timestamps.

The filenames are formatted as YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS_FREQUENCY_SAMPLERATE.xxx

Files on 452.9375 MHz are Front-to-Rear. 457.9375 MHz is Rear-to-Front.

To use the files singly:

direwolf -B EOTD -r 24000 - < 'testfile'.bin

--or all of them:

cat *.bin | direwolf -B EOTD -r 24000 -

--or just from one frequency:

cat *452*.bin | direwolf -B EOTD -r 24000 -
